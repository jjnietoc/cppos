### Intro:
New project to practice everything I've learned of C++ so far.

### Goals:
- [x] Add sqlite
- [ ] Add sqlite for products
- [ ] Create stock software
- [ ] Create retail software
- [ ] Create GUI

This will also work as a pause from my NES project which I would love to eventually go back to.

### Log:
#### 9 mar:
SQLite is now working as intended. Just need to make it work with the previously created objects.

#### 18 feb:
Minor bugs have been solved and the chips category has been created.
I will now proceed to link a database so the program can store memory after been turned off.

#### 16 feb:
##### The program can:
- Create users and assign IDs
- Create products and store them while the program is running

### Next:
- Start with database.
