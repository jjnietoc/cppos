### Intro:
New project to practice everything I've learned of C++ so far.

### Goals:
- [x] Add sqlite
- [x] Add sqlite for products
- [x] Create stock software
- [ ] Create retail software
- [ ] Create GUI

This will also work as a pause from my NES project which I would love to eventually go back to.

### Log:
#### 22 mar:
Stock software finished! (for the moment). 
I will now start developing for using the user side of the whole program,
before finishing with the retail side.

#### 19 mar:
SQLite create and insert work as intended for both objects. 
Next step is to make the whole thing a switch case for different necessities.
This will conclude the stock side of the software for now.

#### 9 mar:
SQLite is now working as intended. Just need to make it work with the previously created objects.

#### 18 feb:
Minor bugs have been solved and the chips category has been created.
I will now proceed to link a database so the program can store memory after been turned off.

#### 16 feb:
##### The program can:
- Create users and assign IDs
- Create products and store them while the program is running

### Next:
- Create main software.
