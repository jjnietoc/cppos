### Intro:
New project to practice everything I've learned of C++ so far.

### Goals:
- [ ] Add sqlite as database for users and products
- [ ] Create stock software
- [ ] Create retail software
- [ ] Create GUI

This will also work as a pause from my NES project which I would love to eventually go back to.

### Log:
#### 16 feb:
##### The program can:
- Create users and assign IDs
- Create products and store them while the program is running

### Next:
- After solving minor bugs, I would like to create one more product model and then start creating the sqlite interface to store everything even if the program is stopped.
